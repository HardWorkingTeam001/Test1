3. Branching & Merging (Intermediate)

ðŸ”‘ Goal: Work on new features without breaking main code.

Concepts to Learn:

Branches (feature, bugfix, release).

Merging & resolving conflicts.

HTTPS vs SSH authentication.


Fast-forward vs. no-fast-forward merges.


Hands-on Commands:

git branch feature-1       # create branch
git checkout feature-1     # switch branch
git merge feature-1        # merge into main
git branch -d feature-1    # delete branch

Practice Idea:
Create two branches, make changes in both, and merge them back. Handle a merge conflict manually.
